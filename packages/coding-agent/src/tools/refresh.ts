/**
 * refresh — re-read frozen-at-session-start config into the live session.
 *
 * A running session freezes its skills, rules, settings/default-model, and MCP
 * registry at start. On a long-lived agent (a wave that stays up for hours) an
 * on-disk change — a nix-synced new skill, an edited rulebook, a config.yml
 * model switch — is invisible until restart. `refresh` re-scans those surfaces
 * and swaps the fresh values in without dropping the conversation, so a
 * supervisor can broadcast "run refresh" and every agent picks up the update at
 * once.
 *
 * Pure re-READ: no config file is written (the `/model` reformat footgun is
 * avoided by construction). Scoped so an agent that only needs the roster does
 * not disturb settings/MCP. The `/refresh` slash command is the human surface.
