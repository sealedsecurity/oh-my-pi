/**
 * In-session roster reload — re-scan skills + rules from disk and swap the
 * process-global snapshots without tearing down the session.
 *
 * Everything the harness reads once at session-start is otherwise frozen for
 * that session's life. A mid-wave change to a skill or rule (a nix sync of a
 * new skill, an edited rulebook entry) is invisible to already-running sessions
 * until a full restart. This primitive re-runs the exact discovery pipeline
 * `createAgentSession` runs at init (`sdk.ts` `discoverSkills` +
 * `loadCapability(ruleCapability)` + `bucketRules`) and re-publishes the
 * `activeSkills`/`activeRules` globals with a pointer swap.
 *
 * The caller (`AgentSession.refresh`) is responsible for the parts a global
 * swap does NOT reach: the per-session `#skills` snapshot that `skill://`
 * actually binds (see `AgentSession.applyReloadedSkills`) and the system-prompt
 * rebuild that re-renders the advertised roster.
